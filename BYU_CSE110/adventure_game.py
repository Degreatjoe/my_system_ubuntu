CREATIVITY:
I shared my code with a couple of people who pointed out my errors 
at the beginingof completing this project, i was really feeling overwhelmed.

The coment i got from my peers where that although i took a more
complicated route my work is amazing,, i just need to learn to make things
simpler to read and understand
